# Mean_Anomaly_Method-
This code can transform orbital elements to state vectors and vice versa. It can also predict the state vectors of the satellite, given the starting position and time travelled.
It uses the Newton_Raphson method to iteratively solve for the eccentric anomaly at another epoch.

The code is in the form of an a Python Notebook, and hence the equations used have been explained then and there.
